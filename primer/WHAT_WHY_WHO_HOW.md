# What, Why, Who, and How?

## What is Cold Brewed Coffee?
Cold brewed coffee is simply coffee that has been brewed at or below room temperature. This method of brewing is akin to brewing tea, in that you're steeping the coffee grounds over several hours. Cold brewed coffee is **not** iced coffee. Iced coffee is hot brewed coffee that is then poured over ice and, as such, will have the same problem that causes people to generally avoid hot brewed coffee; that is, it's going to be bitter. Cold brewed coffee is less acidic (and less bitter), smoother, and has more flavor than hot brewed coffee.

## Why Cold Brew?
From conversations I've had with people who either cold brew or are interested in it, the primary reasons to cold brew seem to be to reduce the acidity and bitterness of coffee and to improve the flavor. Other reasons include the customizability of the strength of the coffee, the ability to precisely reproduce the resultant coffee, and even just to give your inner "Mad Scientist" some yard time.

## Who Cold Brews?
Many of the people interested in cold brewing are people who have never developed a taste for hot brewed coffee because of the bitterness. Of course, people who enjoy hot brewed coffee can also enjoy cold brewed coffee; anecdotally, they seem equally happy with either and tend to cold brew less often. Mostly, it seems to be people who have an interest in being able to customize their coffee to precisely suit themselves.

## How Do You Cold Brew?
At the most basic level, you need a jar, the ability to filter the grounds, time, and patience. Cold brewing doesn't require any attention from you between starting and ending the process. Temperature affects how quickly or slowly extraction occurs, and you can use that to fit your brewing in around the rest of your activities.
