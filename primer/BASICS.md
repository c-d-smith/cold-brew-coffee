## Coffee
The most important things you need to know about coffee are grinds and roasts. I'm no expert; I've learned just enough about these topics to be dangerous. You'll have to lean on the Internet for additional learning on these topics, but I'll share what I've learned.

### Grinds
This is actually pretty simple, with respect to cold brewing: You want as coarse a grind as you can get. This means you'll be buying whole bean coffee, rather than pre-ground. The reason for this is pre-ground coffee is ground for use with automatic coffee makers that use paper filters. You could even brew with whole, unground beans, though that would increase the brewing time in a way that I can't predict.

### Roasts
This is a more complex subject than grinds, and I know only enough to be able to make intelligent choices for myself and brew coffee. Light roasts have the highest caffeine and acid content, while dark roasts have the lowest caffeine and acid content. The roast also supposedly has an impact on flavor, but I haven't done enough experimentation with this to have first-hand knowledge. If you really want to learn about roasts, you'll definitely need other resources.

### Caffeine Sensitivity
This seems like the best place to discuss this topic. Obviously, everyone's tolerance of caffeine is different. Studies have shown there is a genetic component and an environmental component. The genetic component is something we each have to discover for ourselves. As for the environmental component, the information I've found shows that smokers clear caffeine from their systems at about twice the rate of non-smokers. I haven't sought out more information about this, though; so if this interests you, you'll need to do your own research.

I bring up caffeine sensitivity because, if you're new to coffee, it might affect you in unexpected ways. It did for me; if I'm not careful, I can easily end up with badly disrupted sleep or even being awake most of the night without falling asleep. So the recipes that I share here are balanced with that in mind, and you may need to change them.

## Grinders
There are **many** grinders available, from the very cheap to the incredibly expensive, and they offer a host of different features. The purported best grinders for cold brew coffee are burr grinders, which (as I understand it) reduce or eliminate the amount of very fine grounds. In turn, that will reduce or eliminate sedimentation during brewing. (Sedimentation will be discussed more later.)

If you're new to coffee, like I was, I would recommend choosing a cheap grinder to start, which is what I did. Many cheap grinders are "one touch", which doesn't mean it automatically stops; rather, "one touch" means the grinder is only on while you're holding the button down. Ultimately, I settled on a Hamilton Beach that automatically stops, has a dial selector to choose the granularity, and a lever selector to tell the grinder the quantity of beans to grind. It's $15 at Wal-Mart, or $26 on Amazon. I made this choice because I wanted consistency in the granularity of my grinds. Obviously, you're free to select the grinder that fits your budget and taste.

## Carafes
Fortunately, the choices in carafes are considerably fewer than grinders. Amazon has a number of options available and I believe I even saw some bespoke carafes at Wal-Mart. Before you decide what you'll use to brew coffee, remember that the coffee has to be stored in the refrigerator after brewing. Most often, you'll be storing it in the carafe. So the best carafes are short, relatively narrow, easy to grip, and durable. Here is an [Amazon search](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cold+brew+carafe&ref=nb_sb_noss) for cold brew carafes. Most of them are tall, some have wide bases (like the [one I bought](https://www.amazon.com/Gourmia-Removable-Steeping-Airtight-Freshest/dp/B073DMKC46/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=gourmia+cold+brew+carafe&qid=1576263716&sr=8-3)), and many are made of very thin glass. A number of reviewers complained about carafes breaking; mine did not, though I was particularly careful not to bump it on anything or drag it when picking it up or putting it down. There are also more expensive systems available.

As with the grinder, I wanted to start cheap, since I wasn't sure I'd even like cold brewed coffee. In my opinion, the best system is the simplest: Mason jars with a [Klein stainless steel filter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0721RVRYN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Mason jars are cheap, easy to grasp, durable, easily replaced, and easy to store in the refrigerator (because they're short and relatively narrow). Mason jars also afford you the ability to brew multiple different flavors at once without filling up your refrigerator with coffee, as well as the ability to scale your brewing up and down.

## Filters
If you purchase a cold brewing system, they'll come with their own filtration system. So you're only going to have a choice of filters if you choose something like Mason jars for brewing. In spite of the fact that I think a [stainless steel filter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0721RVRYN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) is **the** way to go because of the small size of the grounds they're able to retain and their ease of set up and clean up, we'll review a short list of other options:
  * Paper filters
  * Cheesecloth and nut milk bags

While you can choose to filter the coffee after it's made using a paper filter, it seems to me that this method would likely end up making a bit of a mess. If you use paper filters, you obviously wouldn't be able to put them in the Mason jar to hold the grounds. This means you'll have to pour the coffee from one jar into another with the paper filter between.

Cheesecloth and nut milk bags hold the grounds in the Mason jar while you're brewing. They're more porous than the 100 micron holes in the stainless steel filter I linked above, which means larger grounds will be able to escape into your coffee. While simple cheesecloth will be as easy to clean as the stainless steel filter (dump, rinse, done), I suspect nut milk bags would take more rinsing to get the coffee out. You'll also need to squeeze the cheesecloth or nut milk bag to get most of the liquid coffee out before dumping.

Even if you choose a stainless steel filter, if you're using a grinder that is not a burr grinder (and maybe even if you are), then you'll get some sediment at the bottom of your jar. Your first reaction to that is probably "Yuck!", followed by "What causes that?". The sediment is caused mainly by the very fine particles that result from the grinding process. From what I've read online, you can create more by shaking the jar, which causes the grounds to break up some. I don't go out of my way to create more sediment, even though I have fouund the sediment is basically pure flavor. I've also found that, outside of the enhanced flavor, you don't notice the sediment while you're drinking the coffee - even if you make sure to shake or swirl your coffee to mix up the sediment (and I do this). If you don't want the sediment, simply don't swirl the coffee in the jar when you're pouring it. The sediment settles to the bottom and will stay there unless you forcibly stir it up.

When it comes to shaking the jar after adding the coffee grounds, some people do this and I honestly lack any understanding of the utility they find in this action. I **think** that they think this helps to make sure the coffee grounds all get wet. I have never found this to be a problem with the filter I use. By the time I'm ready to put the lid on the jar, the grounds are all wet and have settled into the water so there are no peaks or valleys.

## Ratio of Water to Coffee
During my research, the most frequent ratio I found was four cups water to one cup coffee grounds. However, I don't think that many literal measuring cups' worth is actually meant because, when I tried that ratio, the coffee I brewed was so strong that if I drank more than 0.25c (2oz) of it per day, then I would spend most of the night awake. That said, in the recipes I'm sharing, I do actually measure everything out with a measuring cup.

I've had to ignore the information I found online and find a ratio that works for me. My recipes are a good starting point, and you may need to tweak them to suit yourself. Finally, obviously, if you change the ratio, you make the coffee stronger or weaker.
