# Infusions
There is precious little information available about infusions or infusion recipes. I have come across one site that gives a nice explainer of what an infusion is, but they didn't offer any recipes as they're in the business of selling pre-mixed coffee infusions for brewing at home. I'm not going to provide a definition, since I'm expecting you either already know what it is or can intuit it.

I have only recently started experimenting with infusions, and I am very excited to do, learn, and share more about this in the future. Infusions offer a way to improve the flavor profile of a coffee you already buy or create a flavor that you otherwise can't find. They also offer an additional avenue to customizing your coffee exactly to your tastes.

Unfortunately, all of this means that if a recipe for a flavor you want doesn't exist here, you'll need to do the experimentation necessary to create it. If you do, I would be very happy to include it here!

## Recipes
Here is the [comprehensive list of recipes](https://github.umn.edu/cdsmith/cold-brew-coffee/tree/master/recipes). Here are the infusion recipes:
