# Infusions
There is precious little information available about infusions or infusion recipes. I have come across one site that gives a nice explainer of what an infusion is, but they didn't offer any recipes as they're in the business of selling pre-mixed coffee infusions for brewing at home. I'm not going to provide a definition, since I'm expecting you either already know what it is or can intuit it.

Infusions offer a way to improve the flavor profile of a coffee you already buy or create a flavor that you otherwise can't find. They also offer an additional avenue to customizing your coffee exactly to your tastes. Through experimentation, I have found it is generally advisable to avoid using infusion ingredients with high levels of natural sugar. I have tried brewing using pineapple and orange, and found that both leave a very sticky mess. I have not tried with dried, unsugared fruit because my tolerance for cleaning up such a mess is virtually nil. The only other thing I *am* interested in trying is using orange or lemon zest in an infusion. I just have yet to find a coffee I feel would benefit from that.

Unfortunately, all of this means that if a recipe for a flavor you want doesn't exist here, you'll need to do the experimentation necessary to create it. If you do, I would be very happy to include it here!

## Recipes
Here is the [comprehensive list of recipes](https://github.com/c-d-smith/cold-brew-coffee/tree/master/recipes). I am not going to break out a separate list of infusions here because it will be more work to maintain.
