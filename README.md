# Cold Brew Coffee
I created this repository to help educate anyone new to cold brewing, reduce the learning curve (and associated cost), and share recipes for flavors that I (or others) have tried. If you're brand new to cold brewing, especially if you've never done it before, please start with this (hopefully) [helpful primer](https://github.umn.edu/cdsmith/cold-brew-coffee/blob/master/primer/README.md). The primer covers what cold brewed coffee is, why you might prefer it, and the basic stuff you need to get started.

If you're already enjoying cold brewed coffee, you can learn about [infusions](https://github.umn.edu/cdsmith/cold-brew-coffee/blob/master/primer/INFUSIONS.md) or you can skip right to [the recipes](https://github.umn.edu/cdsmith/cold-brew-coffee/blob/master/recipes/README.md).

If you have a recipe or other information you want to share, I'd be very happy to hear from you! You can request to become a collaborator on this repository or you can simply email me at cdsmith@umn.edu to share a recipe or discuss any information presented here (or that you feel is missing).
