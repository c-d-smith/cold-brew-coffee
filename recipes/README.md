# About the Recipes
I use a measuring cup for all the measures provided. That way, there is no misunderstanding and the results are precisely reproducible. You may need to change the amount of beans used, but this will get you started. In addition to varying the amount of beans, you can make the coffee stronger by brewing it for longer.

## Other Information
The Whole Earth Grocery Co-op is located in River Falls, Wisconsin. They specialize in organic and fair trade products. They roast their coffee on-site. Their coffee is not artificially flavored.

Scatterbrain Coffee is in Downsville, WI. They also trade in organic and fair trade products. When buying their coffee, pay attention to the origin because they source coffee beans from several different countries. I've only just started trying their products and so I do not yet know how important the origin is. Their coffee is not artificially flavored.

Please don't forget that the recipes are a starting point. Don't be afraid to change things and experiment.
