# About the Recipes
I use a measuring cup for all the measures provided. That way, there is no misunderstanding and the results are precisely reproducible. You may need to change the amount of beans used, but this will get you started. In addition to varying the amount of beans, you can make the coffee stronger by brewing it for longer.
