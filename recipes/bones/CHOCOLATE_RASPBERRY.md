## Recipe
  * Coffee: 0.25c (2oz)
  * Water: 3.5c (28oz)
  * Time: 15 hours

I have brewed this flavor for 12, 15, 18, and 24 hours. I prefer a little bite, which is what I get at 15 hours. You can reduce the bitterness by reducing the brewing time. I have found it enjoyable even at an 18 hour brewing time, but that introduces more of a bitter flavor than I prefer. I find the raspberry to be a bit overpowered by the chocolate, and so I tend to brew this as a [raspberry infusion](https://github.com/c-d-smith/cold-brew-coffee/blob/master/recipes/bones/infusions/CHOCOLATE_RASPBERRY.md).
