This coffee has a strong flavor, making it tolerant of over-brewing. The suggested brewing time produces a deep ruby-colored coffee, with a strong chocolate flavor featuring undertones of raspberry. As you increase the brewing time, the color will change to black. Conversely, decreasing the brewing time will produce a redder coffee.

I have brewed this flavor for 12, 15, 18, and 24 hours. I prefer a little bite, which is what I get at 15 hours. You can reduce the bitterness by reducing the brewing time. I have found it enjoyable even at an 18 hour brewing time, but that introduces more of a bitter flavor than I prefer.
