Seasonal? No

## Recipe
  * Coffee: 0.25c (2oz)
  * Water: 3.5c (28oz)
  * Time: 16 hours, unrefrigerated or 48 hours, refrigerated

This coffee has a strong flavor that develops slowly and requires a longer brewing time to extract. I have brewed this at both 16 hours on the countertop and 48 hours in the refrigerator, and both brewing times turned out a good brew. Personally, I like this better as an infusion using coconut flakes because I feel there is better balance between the coconut and rum flavors.
