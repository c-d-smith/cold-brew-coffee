Seasonal? No

## Recipe
  * Coffee: 0.25c (2oz)
  * Water: 3.5c (28oz)
  * Time: 16 hours

I have brewed this at 12 hours and 16 hours on the countertop. I found the flavor to be better at 16 hours. Personally, I like this better as a [coconut flake infusion](https://github.com/c-d-smith/cold-brew-coffee/blob/master/recipes/bones/infusions/COCONUT_RUM.md) because I feel there is better balance between the coconut and rum flavors.
