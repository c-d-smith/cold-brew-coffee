This coffee has a strong flavor, making it tolerant of over-brewing. The suggested brewing time produces a honey-colored coffee with a good rum flavor and coconut undertones. As you increase the brewing time, the color will change to amber, then to black.

I have brewed this flavor at 12, 15, and 18 hours. I found the flavor to be masked too much for my tastes at 18 hours, though I could still detect the rum. Be aware that the coconut is quickly masked, and is quite subtle after 15 hours. While I like this flavor and will order it again, I was disappointed by the subtlety of the coconut. In the future, I will brew this as a toasted coconut infusion.
