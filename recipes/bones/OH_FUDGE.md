## Recipe
  * Coffee: 0.25c (2oz)
  * Water: 3.5c (28oz)
  * Time: 12 hours

This coffee has a subtle flavor, making it fairly intolerant of over-brewing. While you can brew it longer to introduce some bitterness, I've found the flavor is quickly masked. The suggested brewing time produces a deep brown coffee with little bitterness and a good flavor. As you increase the brewing time, the color will quickly change to black.

I have brewed this flavor for 12, 15, and 18 hours. For those who dislike bitter coffee, 15 hours is the maximum brewing time I would recommend. At 18 hours, I found the flavor almost completely masked by the bitterness.
