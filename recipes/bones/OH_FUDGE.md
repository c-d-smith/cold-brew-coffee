I really like this flavor. It has a nutty flavor that I initially confused as acidity/bitterness from the coffee. I've brewed this for 12, 15, 16, 18, and 24 hours on the countertop, as well as 48 hours in the refrigerator. So far, I like the 16 hour/48 hour brew times the best, but I'm planning to try this with a longer brewing time again.
