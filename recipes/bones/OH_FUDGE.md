# Oh Fuuudge!

Seasonal? Yes; Christmas

## Recipe
  * Coffee: 0.25c (2oz)
  * Water: 3.5c (28oz)
  * Time: 15 hours

This coffee has a subtle flavor, and seems to have a narrow window between being under-brewed and over-brewed. The suggested brewing time produces a deep brown coffee with little bitterness and a good flavor. As you increase the brewing time, the color will quickly change to black.

I have brewed this flavor for 12, 15, and 18 hours. I found a 12 hour brew to have too little flavor, while an 18 hour brew has too much bitterness and acidity.
