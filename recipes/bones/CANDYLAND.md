## Recipe
  * Coffee: 0.25c (2oz)
  * Water: 3.5c (28oz)
  * Time: 12 hours

This coffee has a medium flavor, making it somewhat tolerant of over-brewing. The suggested brewing time produces a medium brown coffee with little bitterness and a good flavor.

This flavor is white chocolate covered gumdrops. So you need to really like gumdrops to enjoy this. We purchased this for my wife and so I have only brewed this once so far. I disliked the flavor, but she went crazy for it.
