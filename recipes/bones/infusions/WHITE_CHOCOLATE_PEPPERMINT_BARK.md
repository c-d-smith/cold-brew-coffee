Seasonal? Yes; Christmas

## Recipe
  * Coffee: 0.25c (2oz)
  * Water: 3.5c (28oz)
  * Dried Peppermint Leaves: 1 tbsp, level
  * Time: 16 hours

My goal with this infusion was to bring the peppermint flavor up just a touch, in order to bring it into better balance with the white chocolate. I put 2 and 1/2 cups of water and the filter into the Mason jar, then added the peppermint leaves and coffee, then added the final cup of water. I brewed it for 16 hours on the countertop. It turned out so well that it's worth sharing.

As a side note, the only place I could get dried peppermint leaves was Amazon, and the smallest amount I could get is one pound. This is quite a lot of peppermint, but it freezes well since they're dried. It was only $10 and I probably won't need more for another decade.
