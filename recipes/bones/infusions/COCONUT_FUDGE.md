# Oh Fuuudge! with Coconut Infusion
Sold By: [Bones Coffee](https://www.bonescoffee.com/products/oh-fuuudge-12oz)

Seasonal? Yes; Christmas

## Recipe
  * Coffee: 0.25c (2oz)
  * Water: 3.5c (28oz)
  * Unsweetened coconut flakes: 1 tbsp (untoasted)
  * Time: 16 hours

This is brewed the same as the basic Oh Fuuudge! coffee. The flavor with the addition of the coconut flakes is pretty good, though it's not my favorite.
