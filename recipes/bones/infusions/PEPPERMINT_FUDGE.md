# Oh Fuuudge! with Dried Peppermint Leaves Infusion
Sold By: [Bones Coffee](https://www.bonescoffee.com/products/oh-fuuudge-12oz)

Seasonal? Yes; Christmas

## Recipe
  * Coffee: 0.25c (2oz)
  * Water: 3.5c (28oz)
  * Dried Peppermint Leaves: 1 tbsp, level
  * Time: 16 hours, unrefrigerated or 48 hours, refrigerated

This is brewed the same as the basic Oh Fuuudge! coffee. The flavor with the addition of the peppermint leaves is really outstanding, and seems to mask the nuttiness of the coffee a bit.
