## Recipe
  * Coffee: 0.25c (2oz)
  * Water: 3.5c (28oz)
  * Unsweetened coconut flakes: 1 tablespoon (untoasted)
  * Time: 16 hours, unrefrigerated; 48 hours, refrigerated

This coffee has a strong flavor that develops slowly and requires a longer brewing time to extract. I used a level tablespoon of coconut flakes without packing them or mashing them into the tablespoon. It may have been very slightly heaping, but only as much as necessary to be level at the edges of the tablespoon. My goal with this infusion was to have a coffee with a strong flavor and good balance between coconut and rum. I have brewed this at both 16 hours on the countertop and 48 hours in the refrigerator, and both brewing times turned out a good brew. It's really quite outstanding and is easily tied with Salted Caramel for my favorite flavor.

I've also brewed this for 12 hours. My first attempt used 1/4c toasted coconut flakes, while my second attempt used 1/8c untoasted coconut flakes. Using toasted coconut flakes introduces a caramel note to the coffee. At 12 hours, the rum flavor is fairly minimally extracted and is easily over-powered by the coconut. In both cases, I found the flavor to be quite temperature-dependent: The coconut flavor is subdued at lower temperatures and increases as the temperature rises. When I used toasted coconut flakes, the coconut flavor is eventually over-powered by the caramel flavor introduced by the toasted coconut.
