## Recipe
  * Coffee: 0.25c (2oz)
  * Water: 3.5c (28oz)
  * Unsweetened coconut flakes: 2 teaspoons (untoasted)
  * Time: 48 hours, refrigerated

This coffee has a strong flavor that develops slowly and requires a longer brewing time to extract. The suggested brewing time produces a deep amber or caramel colored coffee.

My goal with this infusion was to have a coffee with a strong flavor and good balance between coconut and rum. Brewing for 48 hours in the refrigerator with a small amount of coconut flakes achieves this. It's really quite outstanding and is easily tied with Salted Caramel for my favorite flavor.

I've also brewed this for 12 hours. My first attempt used 1/4c toasted coconut flakes, while my second attempt used 1/8c untoasted coconut flakes. Using toasted coconut flakes introduces a caramel note to the coffee. At 12 hours, the rum flavor is fairly minimally extracted and is easily over-powered by the coconut. In both cases, I found the flavor to be quite temperature-dependent: The coconut flavor is subdued at lower temperatures and increases as the temperature rises. When I used toasted coconut flakes, the coconut flavor is eventually over-powered by the caramel flavor introduced by the toasted coconut.
