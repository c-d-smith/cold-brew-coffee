## Recipe
  * Coffee: 0.25c (2oz)
  * Water: 3.5c (28oz)
  * Unsweetened coconut flakes: 1 tablespoon (untoasted)
  * Time: 16 hours

I used a level tablespoon of coconut flakes without packing them or mashing them into the tablespoon. My goal with this infusion was to have a coffee with a strong flavor and good balance between coconut and rum. It's really quite outstanding and is easily tied with Salted Caramel for my favorite flavor.
