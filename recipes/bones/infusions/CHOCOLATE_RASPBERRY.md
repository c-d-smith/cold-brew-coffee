# Chocolate Raspberry with Raspberry Infusion
Sold By: [Bones Coffee](https://www.bonescoffee.com/products/bones-coffee-company-chocolate-raspberry-coffee-12oz)

Seasonal? Yes; Depends on raspberry availability, though the coffee is not seasonal

## Recipe
  * Coffee: 0.25c (2oz)
  * Water: 3.0c (24oz)
  * Fresh Raspberries: 0.25c (2oz) [About 9 raspberries]
  * Time: 15 hours

I have only brewed this infusion at 15 hours. You can vary the flavor by steeping the raspberries in water for a few hours before adding the coffee, as well as varying the brewing time once the coffee is added. Since raspberries are naturally tart, you need not worry about the coffee becoming very sweet while brewing.

Originally, I was brewing this with about 18 raspberries, but I've found that I prefer it with fewer raspberries. For me, the balance between the chocolate and raspberry swung too far toward raspberry when I used that many berries.
