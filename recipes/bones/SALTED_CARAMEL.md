## Recipe
  * Coffee: 0.25c (2oz)
  * Water: 3.5c (28oz)
  * Time: 12 hours

This coffee has a strong flavor, making it tolerant of over-brewing. This lets you increase the brewing time to dial in your preferred balance between bitterness and flavor. The suggested brewing time produces a honey-colored coffee with little bitterness and an excellent flavor. As you increase the brewing time, the color will change to amber and then black.

I have brewed this flavor for 12, 15, 18, and 24 hours. If you dislike bitter coffee, I would not recommend more than a 15 hour brewing time as - in my experience - the bitterness tends to overwhelm the flavor with longer brewing times.
