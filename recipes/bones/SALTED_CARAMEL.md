## Recipe
  * Coffee: 0.25c (2oz)
  * Water: 3.5c (28oz)
  * Time: 12 hours

I have brewed this flavor for 12, 15, 18, and 24 hours on the countertop. I liked the 12 hour brew the best because I felt I got the most flavor with the least bitterness. It's got a really strong flavor and is one of my favorite Bones flavors.
