# White Chocolate Peppermint Bark
Sold By: [Bones Coffee](https://www.bonescoffee.com/products/white-chocolate-peppermint-bark-by-bones-coffee-company-12oz)

Seasonal? Yes; Christmas

## Recipe
  * Coffee: 0.25c (2oz)
  * Water: 3.5c (28oz)
  * Time: 16 hours

I have brewed this for 12, 15, 16, 18, and 24 hours. The 16 hour brewing time has turned out the best. The peppermint flavor is rather subtle, and I prefer this as a [dried peppermint leaf infusion](https://github.com/c-d-smith/cold-brew-coffee/blob/master/recipes/bones/infusions/WHITE_CHOCOLATE_PEPPERMINT_BARK.md).
