Seasonal? Yes; Christmas

## Recipe
  * Coffee: 0.25c (2oz)
  * Water: 3.5c (28oz)
  * Time: 16 hours

I have brewed this for 12, 15, 16, and 18 hours. So far, I've liked the 16 hour brew time the best, but I'm going to try a longer brewing time again. I think the way I made the coffee after brewing resulted in a poor result for the 18 hour brewing time. The peppermint flavor is somewhat subtle at 16 hours (and almost non-existent at 12 hours), but it is detectable.
